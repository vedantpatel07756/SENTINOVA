🔍 SENTINOVA is a web application for sentimental analysis that my team and I developed. Users can register and upload CSV files containing tweets or comments for analysis. Based on the uploaded data, SENTINOVA generates a result page showcasing the average sentiment, distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, top 5 words for each sentiment category, total hashtags, total mentions, and total tweets scanned.
